       <h1>The Art of Coffee</h1>

       <h2>Smaller is Better</h2>
       <p>Many of our specialty beans come from a single farm or even from a specific area on the farm, so they are limited in quantity and superior in quality.<br>
         We buy directly from the farmers and have established strong, long-term relationships, based on good coffee and fair prices.</p>

         <h2>Our Process</h2>
         <p>Roasting coffee to perfection is exacting, but not mysterious. Hereâ€™s how we do it:
           <ol>
             <li>Travel the globe to find the best coffee beans.</li>
             <li>Buy entire micro-lots of great beans at a fair price.</li>
             <li>Roast with artistry and advanced technology.</li>
             <li>Control quality from grower to roaster to barista to consumer.</li>
          </ol></p>
